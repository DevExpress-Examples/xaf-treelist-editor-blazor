Project Description

This project implements a Blazor Module. Platform-specific application elements
can be implemented here (Controllers, Editors & View Items, etc.). The root project
folder contains the BlazorModule.cs(vb) file with the class that inherits ModuleBase.
This class allows you to view and customize Module components:
referenced modules, Controllers and business classes. Additionally, the root folder
contains Application Model difference files (XAFML files) that keep application
settings specific for the current Module. Difference files can be customized in code 
or in the Model Editor for .NET Core and .NET Standard (Beta).
